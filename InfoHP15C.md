# Acknowledgements #

The HP-15C emulator for the iPhone was written and is maintained by Thomas Fors.  The core emulation code was ported from the [Mac OS X port](http://homepage.mac.com/mba/nonpareil/) of [Nonpareil](http://nonpareil.brouhaha.com/).

# Revision History #

  * **Version 1.0.9** - Fixed bug that caused splash screen to appear on every launch.

  * **Version 1.0.8** - Updated to work with firmware 1.1.3.  Updated pop-up menu accessed by clicking the HP logo.  Fixed bug in C/R temperature conversion.

  * **Version 1.0.7** - Adds Preferences menu with the ability to customize keyclicks and automatic checking for updates.  Adds length unit conversion.  Fixes a bug in C/K temperature conversion.  Tap on the HP logo to access the new features.

  * **Version 1.0.6** - Fixes a bug that prevented the calculator from launching properly on phones with firmware 1.0.2.

  * **Version 1.0.5** - Adds a popup menu with some numeric constants and unit conversion (temperature only for now).  Tap on the HP logo to the right of the calculator display to activate.  If you would like to see a specific constant added or suggest a unit conversion, please enter a [support issue](http://code.google.com/p/hpcalc-iphone/issues/list).

  * **Version 1.0.4** - Fixes bugs in the keypad and display.  Multi-key presses should now work.  For example, the "ON" & "." sequence for changing the digit separators now works.  Also, the "f", "PREFIX" function now properly displays the mantissa while "PREFIX" is held down.  Also fixes the display of digit separators which was broken in the last version and slightly enlarged the valid "hit" area for keys.

  * **Version 1.0.3** - Adds persistent memory.  When you exit HP-15C and return to the springboard, the calculator will remember its program memory and registers when it is next launched.

  * **Version 1.0.2** - Corrected a typo on the keypad legend.  "Px,y" was changed to "Py,x" and "Cx,y" was changed to "Cy,x" to match the real calculator keypad.

  * **Version 1.0.1** - Cleaned up the annunciator display (e.g. "f", "g", "PRGM", etc.)

  * **Version 1.0** - Initial public release.
