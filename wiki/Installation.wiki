== Prerequisite ==

Until Apple releases a software development kit to enable 3rd parties to "officially" write apps for the iPhone, you'll need to jailbreak your iPhone.  See [http://iphone.fiveforty.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page here] for instructions.


== Installation ==

The easiest method of installing is with Installer.app:
  # Launch Installer.app on your phone.
  # Tap the Sources tab at the bottom.
  # Tap the Edit button at the top.
  # Tap the Add button at the top.
  # Enter the following url: {{{http://tinyurl.com/2b32sn}}}
  # Click OK.
  # Go to the Install tab and scroll down to Utilities.
  # In the Utilities section, you should see HP-15C. Select it and tap Install.
