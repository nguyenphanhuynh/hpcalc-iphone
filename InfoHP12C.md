The HP-12C emulator for the iPhone was written and is maintained by Thomas Fors.  The core emulation code was ported from the [Mac OS X port](http://homepage.mac.com/mba/nonpareil/) of [Nonpareil](http://nonpareil.brouhaha.com/).

# Revision History #

  * **Version 1.0.6** - Fixed bug that caused splash screen to appear on every launch.

  * **Version 1.0.5** - Updated to work with firmware 1.1.3.  Updated pop-up menu accessed by clicking the HP logo.

  * **Version 1.0.4** - Adds Preferences menu with the ability to customize keyclicks and automatic checking for updates.  Tap on the HP logo to the right of the display to access the new features.

  * **Version 1.0.3** - Fixes bugs in the keypad and display.  Multi-key presses should now work.  For example, the "ON" & "." sequence for changing the digit separators now works.  Also, the "f", "PREFIX" function now properly displays the mantissa while "PREFIX" is held down.  Also fixes the display of digit separators which was broken in the last version and slightly enlarged the valid "hit" area for keys.

  * **Version 1.0.2** - Adds persistent memory.  When you exit HP-12C and return to the springboard, the calculator will remember its program memory and registers when it is next launched.

  * **Version 1.0.1** - Fixed bug where vertical orientation status bar was displayed during application launch.

  * **Version 1.0** - Initial public release.
